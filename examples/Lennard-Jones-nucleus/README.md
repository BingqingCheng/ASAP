this is an example on a single frame of a Lennard-Jones system. The system contains a solid nucleus inside undercooled liquid. The file "FCCUBIC.list" provides a list of FCCUBIC order parameter, which distinguishes atomic enviroments in a fcc-like environment, of each atom in the frame.
 
we use the ASAP tools to identify the difference in atomic environments of the atoms inside this system.
